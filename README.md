# Job-Cost-Estimate-Backend

This is a backend service I have developed for a job cost estimate application designed for a concrete piling company. 
The application allows users to input job details and receive an estimated cost based on various parameters.

I was givin permission from the company to share this code as an example of the work I have done for them.

## Features
- User authentication and authorization
- Restful API for job cost estimates
- Backend code for usage in a React frontend application
- MongoDB Prisma Schema for database management
